As a good becomes a product, people are able to make product property.
Properties allow people to evaluate products giving people an opportunity to increase the value.
As a product evolves to perpetuate attributes, people begin to create channels to permit the products transportation designing the infrastructure to optimize growth.
As a product goes through the infrastructure indicators, the provided opportunity to maximize the channels create destiny [destination].
The environmental adaptability provides a product the opportunity to be independence, causing the environment to depend on the product to be stable.
As a product begins to enter an environment, attempting to channel similar products together, a product must strengthen unique bonds to permit encapsulation or momentum.
To collect similar products as the product goes through the chnanel to create a leading product in an environment. As a leading product begins to improve, products begin to combine with the leading product increasingly more.
As a product characterizes the impact the environment more, the product becomes greater. 
As a product reaches centralization, the product directly impacts the environment.

[ Page 13 ]
As a product centralizes the necessity to evolve uniquely in an inepdendent environment, the product becomes a survival mechanism to create stability.
A product's technique to compete: creates enivonrmental impacting applications.
As a product begins to fit in the greatest environment, the products become increasingly valuable.

[ Page 14 ]
As goods or values go through channels the necessity to protect the product becomes a paramount importance as the product reaches a destination.
Evolving a legendary architecture permits the goods to go through simply.
Through creating environmental indiators the goods may build on an open architecture enabling an evolutationary platform to construct applications creating a more valuable environment for people.
As architecture becomes more versatile, people are able to perform more creating an imperfect architecture to allow contributions to create a transcending environment as a spectrum becomes limitless through design.
As goods go through an environment, the necessity to keep the goods intact is essential at keeping purity.

[ Page 15 ]
As goods is purity, the goods may go through transportation straight to the destination, keeping the goods between the source to target is vital to keeping the goods valuable.
Certain goods may be built to bypass environmental indicators going straight to the destination. 
As goods go through an environment, certain sensors may build products to create greater value for the people. 
Through comrpehension, the sensors cause good creation occuring to perpetuate value.

[ Page 16 ]
As goods or values go through an environment, entities begin to package to transport through infrastrastructure to the destination using trusting channels.
Storing goods permits product grwoth as resources become more available to support creating an optimal package.
Presenting goods in an architecture potrays a product inspiring use.

[ Page 17 ]
Through presenting products a person may perform exceptional acts creating a new pattern.
As a person begins trending value becomes apparent permitting rule creation comprehending a rule establishes action opportunity.

[ Page 18 ]
Through interior design people may comprehend the environment enabling a good contribution.
As providing design creates opportunity, reading the architecture enables exceptional patternizing.

[ Page 19 ]
Createing an open architecture enabling people action creates a transcending environment pushing the spectrum limits.
The infrastructure forms channels which goods flow through creating products. 
By analyzing trends, people may comprehend the pattern value perpetuating property improvements.

[ Page 20]
Mastery is acting on value produce creating goods producing products as channel comrpehension increases enabling pattern creation through a transparent environment providing design contributions which build on architecture.
