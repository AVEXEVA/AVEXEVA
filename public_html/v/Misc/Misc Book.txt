I am an animal of instinct writing words to better understand the simplicity found in describing events which may become marks on my life. 
As certain stepping stones are told: certain fundamental truths awaken. 
Although the words written are my own, I write on my father's computer. 
I did not make the computer: the hardware. 
I did not make the system: the operating system.
And although I did not buy this computer myself, the words written are authentically my own.
On the journey to better be aware, I will confornt certain hardships as the clout of my actions have been realized.
Awakening myself is the key point to unlocking dormant abstract thinking.
No believing must be performed in the process.
Nor listening to others for advice or drawing from perceptua lsubjectiveness.
Certaintly although certain biases will occur and I will do my best in being my own devil's advocate: the truth is what I seek.
I Hope to find It.
